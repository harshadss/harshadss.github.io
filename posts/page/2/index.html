Differential Equations An equation is about balancing two sides of a (weight) balance scale. The equations that we study in school (x + 4 = 9) are about finding the number which will balance the scale. But there could be equations for which solution which balances things is a function and not a number! Specifically, you could have equations which relate a change in certain quantity with respect to that quantity.</p></div>

Linear Algebra Basics There are two ways to look at matrices. One view is about a matrix representing some data (to be covered in later part of this series) Another view is: matrix encodes the operation of a linear system on its inputs. In this (3) view, a matrix represents a linear map. Matrix-vector multiplication is taking a vector represented in one coordinate system and transforming it to vector in another co-ordinate systems.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>I had to study a lot of maths in higher secondary and engineering. There were 2 maths subjects for 2 years after secondary school and 3 maths subjects in the first two years of engineering. Despite studying so much maths, graduate school was a rude shock for me. I just couldn&rsquo;t wrap my head around of a lot of lectures.
The problem was the way maths was taught. Most of the teachers taught maths as an end in itself, mostly devoid of the most important question: &ldquo;why&rdquo;?</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>Throughout my school life I tried to stay away from biology studies. I specifically chose studying physics and maths instead of biology in higher secondary school. Even during secondary school, science 1 generally had physics and chemistry whereas science 2 contained protozoans and all other wiggling beasts. Guess who barely got over line in science 2.
The logic for a high school students in India was simple. You chose biology if you wanted to be a doctor (or do a research in microbiology) which meant spending many years studying and daddy needs to have lot of money to get you into medical school.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2017-12-19</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>I have been teaching machine learning to programmers since some time. I started this activity in 2013 and till date I have conducted 10+ hands on workshops.
All these workshops were typically 3-3.5 hours long and covered some theory, coding examples through Python (ocassionally R) and interactive discussions. They were attended by 10-50 programmers.
Here are some learnings from this teaching activity, in no particular order. Many of them were in fact goof-ups that I did at one point of time, so these are indeed lessons from trenches.</p></div>

				<h4 class="post-date">2017-07-25</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="post-summary"><p>Well the title is intentionally exaggerating. May not the biggest but certainly one of the most important area of friction in taking machine learning to production.
Scenario Imagine that you/your data scientist has written a functional machine learning pipeline in Python today. And by pipeline I mean data transformation as well as prediction code. For example, you could have a data which is mix of text and numeric features. You might do some text processing to generate n-gram features with some custom filters on the text.</p></div>

			<div class="post-summary"><p>In these posts Iâ€™m studying the book Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel and coding the examples in Clojure. Aim: studying clojure and reading this fantastic book can be accessed online here.
In part 4 of this post, we saw the code from chapter 9 of the book about creating a test framework.
In this post, we continue the code of chapter 9 and iron out few kinks in our unit test framework.</p></div>

In part 3 of this post, we saw the code from chapter 3 of the book in which we implemented an in-memory documentish database with select, where and update.
Now I am tackling the code from chapter 9, building a test framework.</p></div>

In part 1 of this post, we went through creating a single database using list and maps.
Chapter 3 continued Looking at database contents In this section, Peter teaches string formatting for CL. Using string formatting, a nicer way to look at db contents is tried.</p></div>
