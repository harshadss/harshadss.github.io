      <description>When you are working with a task where you are interactively building a solution, you need a lot of focus. Most of the work that I do fits into this category. Interactively building solutions to larger problems by solving smaller problems is pioneered by data first tools like Clojure and R.
The first step to achieving the focus required in such interactive work is to remove distractions and complexities from your environments as much as possible.</description>
