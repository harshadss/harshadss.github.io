      <description>Data scientists and machine learning engineers in small and medium businesses often end up over-engineering their machine learning workflow and stack. In a series of posts below, I will share a few tricks learnt over the years related to choosing right components of the ML pipeline.
In this first post, let us go through mistakes small teams can make. Later posts will explain possible solutions.

I believe they are symptoms representing what is the larger problem ailing field of data science. Let us go through the symptoms first. My tone in this article is extremely acerbic because I feel strongly for my field.
Deep Learning Voodo Problem Someone will post a problem like, &amp;ldquo;I am trying to fit (some complex deep learning architecture) model on (a bad problem for starting with DL).</description>
