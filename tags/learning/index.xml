      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often had this experience: certain technical topics look extremely difficult to break into. No matter how many standard resources and popular content that you read through, every one of them seems to speak a foreign language. I&amp;rsquo;ve felt this while studying topics like complex numbers, Fourier&amp;rsquo;s transform, relativity, to name a few.
I am of the opinion that either I&amp;rsquo;m too dumb or writers of many popular expositions on such topics have not understood it clearly.</description>

Differential Equations  An equation is about balancing two sides of a (weight) balance scale. The equations that we study in school (x + 4 = 9) are about finding the number which will balance the scale. But there could be equations for which solution which balances things is a function and not a number! Specifically, you could have equations which relate a change in certain quantity with respect to that quantity.</description>

Linear Algebra Basics  There are two ways to look at matrices. One view is about a matrix representing some data (to be covered in later part of this series) Another view is: matrix encodes the operation of a linear system on its inputs. In this (3) view, a matrix represents a linear map. Matrix-vector multiplication is taking a vector represented in one coordinate system and transforming it to vector in another co-ordinate systems.</description>

      <description>I had to study a lot of maths in higher secondary and engineering. There were 2 maths subjects for 2 years after secondary school and 3 maths subjects in the first two years of engineering. Despite studying so much maths, graduate school was a rude shock for me. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t wrap my head around of a lot of lectures.
The problem was the way maths was taught. Most of the teachers taught maths as an end in itself, mostly devoid of the most important question: &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;?</description>
