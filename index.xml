      <title>Interesting link: quantum reconstruction</title>

      <description>Studying quantum mechanics often gives you an eerie feeling. I tend to feel that something very adhoc is happening. Reading about special relativity is different for example: you start with some reasonable axioms and then the maths kind of follows. But not so a case with quantum mechanics. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to read many books to get sort of a big picture view of what the hell is happening to no avail.</description>

      <description>I sometimes long for those days of internet when you&amp;rsquo;d land on someone&amp;rsquo;s personal page where they&amp;rsquo;d document hard to find links about some (technical) subject matter and some commentary on them. Discovery of such links often meant that that your understanding or interest in certain subject would completely change. I also loved the painstaking effort someone would make to find and then document information for an unknown (web) traveller. There is a kind of romantic hope in doing this, similar to human beings putting out Voyagers spacecrafts with those golden record.</description>

      <title>When (not) to use deep learning</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve documented my disdain for using &amp;lsquo;deep learning as a hammer looking for nails in every corner&amp;rsquo; in few other entries on this blog. Taking a less cynical and acerbic view, I want to focus on when deep learning can be a good starting point and when it is not useful as starting point.
First to clarify bit of terminology. Deep learning is a catch-all term used in popular data science these days.</description>

      <description>Andrew Ng wrote insightful article in HBR a while ago about what an AI can and cannot do. He highlights that if there&amp;rsquo;s a mental task that a human being can do in few seconds, you can probably automate it.
In my opinion, these types of problems have a following structure,
 Single person decisions: these decisions are often replacing decision making of single human being. Scale factor: You need AI to help you in tons of such decisions in order to make meanigful impact.</description>

      <title>Sane Choices for Small Machine Learning Teams: Part 1</title>

      <description>Data scientists and machine learning engineers in small and medium businesses often end up over-engineering their machine learning workflow and stack. In a series of posts below, I will share a few tricks learnt over the years related to choosing right components of the ML pipeline.
In this first post, let us go through mistakes small teams can make. Later posts will explain possible solutions.
Preferring Generalized Solutions Many big companies will perfect a very general solution to machine learning problems by investing obscene amount of resources.</description>

      <title>Curse of ML and DL on Stack Exchange</title>

      <description>I have come across two distinct flavours of beginner behaviours on stack-exchange site related to data science. I believe they are symptoms representing what is the larger problem ailing field of data science. Let us go through the symptoms first. My tone in this article is extremely acerbic because I feel strongly for my field.
Deep Learning Voodo Problem Someone will post a problem like, &amp;ldquo;I am trying to fit (some complex deep learning architecture) model on (a bad problem for starting with DL).</description>

      <description>Click here for introduction to this series and motivation.
Differential Equations  An equation is about balancing two sides of a (weight) balance scale. The equations that we study in school (x + 4 = 9) are about finding the number which will balance the scale. But there could be equations for which solution which balances things is a function and not a number! Specifically, you could have equations which relate a change in certain quantity with respect to that quantity.</description>

      <description>Click here for introduction to this series and motivation.
Linear Algebra Basics  There are two ways to look at matrices. One view is about a matrix representing some data (to be covered in later part of this series) Another view is: matrix encodes the operation of a linear system on its inputs. In this (3) view, a matrix represents a linear map. Matrix-vector multiplication is taking a vector represented in one coordinate system and transforming it to vector in another co-ordinate systems.</description>

      <description>I had to study a lot of maths in higher secondary and engineering. There were 2 maths subjects for 2 years after secondary school and 3 maths subjects in the first two years of engineering. Despite studying so much maths, graduate school was a rude shock for me. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t wrap my head around of a lot of lectures.
The problem was the way maths was taught. Most of the teachers taught maths as an end in itself, mostly devoid of the most important question: &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <title>Readings in Human Body, Evolution and Biology</title>

      <description>Throughout my school life I tried to stay away from biology studies. I specifically chose studying physics and maths instead of biology in higher secondary school. Even during secondary school, science 1 generally had physics and chemistry whereas science 2 contained protozoans and all other wiggling beasts. Guess who barely got over line in science 2.
The logic for a high school students in India was simple. You chose biology if you wanted to be a doctor (or do a research in microbiology) which meant spending many years studying and daddy needs to have lot of money to get you into medical school.</description>
